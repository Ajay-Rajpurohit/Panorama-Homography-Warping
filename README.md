# Panorama-Homography-Warping
Engineered a robust image stitching pipeline, employing ORB for feature detection and RANSAC for outlier removal, to create seamless panoramic images. Enhanced the resulting panoramas by aligning overlapping regions, leveraging homography transformation and warping techniques, delivering high-quality panoramic visuals.
